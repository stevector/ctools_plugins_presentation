<h1>CTools Plugins Explained</h1>

This is a presentation on [CTools Plugins](http://drupal.org/project/ctools) given at
[DrupalCamp Ohio](http://drupalcampohio.org/sessions/ctools-plugins-explained) by [Steve Persch](http://drupal.org/user/179805).

I have also used this deck for a presentation on [Zen Grids](http://stevector.github.com/zen_grids_presentation)

This git repository is a fork of the [Google IO 2012 slide deck](http://code.google.com/p/io-2012-slides/). 
As such, many of the files still contain references to Google and IO 2102.
